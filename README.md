# UI-UX-Experiment5

## Aim:

To understand and apply UX design processes by identifying user pain points, writing UX problem statements, selecting suitable research methods, and creating user personas for two different design scenarios.

## Algorithm:

1.Select two UX project scenarios (e.g., a Health & Fitness App and an E-Government Service Portal).

2.Identify user pain points based on common challenges and user needs.

3.Write clear UX problem statements using the format:
  "[User] needs a way to [achieve goal] because [obstacle], which results in [impact]."

4.Choose appropriate research methods (e.g., interviews, surveys, usability tests) and justify why they are suitable.

5.Create user personas for each scenario including:

   1.Demographics

   2.Goals

   3.Behaviors

   4.Pain Points

   5.Motivations

 6.Present findings for each scenario in structured form.

 7.Analyze outcomes to understand how UX methods improve user-centered design.

## Output:

  Scenario 1: Health & Fitness Tracking App

  Problem Statement 1: Busy professionals need a way to track fitness progress easily because existing apps require too much manual input, which results in low engagement.

  3Research Methods: User interviews and usability testing.

  Personas:

  Rahul Verma – 32, IT Manager, needs quick, personalized fitness tracking.

  Aisha Khan – 25, Marketing Executive, wants motivation and progress visualization.

  Scenario 2: E-Government Service Portal

   Problem Statement 1: Citizens need a way to apply for services online easily because current portals are confusing, leading to incomplete applications.

   Research Methods: Surveys and contextual inquiry.

  Personas:

  Ramesh Kumar – 48, Business Owner, moderate digital literacy.

  Meena Iyer – 60, Retired Teacher, struggles with accessibility and navigation.

## Result:

By conducting this experiment, we understood how defining UX problem statements, selecting suitable research methods, and creating personas contribute to designing user-centered solutions. The process highlights the importance of empathy and structured research in UX design.
